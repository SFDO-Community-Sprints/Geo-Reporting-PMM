# Project Name
Geographic Reporting enhancements for PMM and NPSP

# Project Overview
## Vision & Goals
Our goal is to create a reference architecture for users to be able to map addresses to geographic regions based on a given shapefile. For example, a frequent use-case for non-profits is reporting county-level data, but the standard functionality of the Data.com geocoder does not return data at that level -- only the latitude and longitude coordinates.  

* Provide a framework for someone lightly-familar with GIS to create reference records in Salesforce to map to non-standard geographies. 
* Create a solution that allows us to match a single latitude-longitude pair to one of the reference records.
* Connect this geodata to program services and other objects leveraged in the PMM Module.
* Create some basic reporting that would allow and end-user to analyze data based off the linkage to a region. 

## Project Vertical
Non-profit, Education, other use-cases as well.
