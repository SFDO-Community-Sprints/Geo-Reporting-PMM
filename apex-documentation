As of Sep 2021:

The Apex which is part of this package contains two classes with two key functions. 

*geoCodey_UTIL method: populateExtremePoints and class geoCodey_ExtremePoint_BATCH*
The purpose of these two is to calculate the extreme points of a given polygon and save those values to fields on the Geographic Definition record. 
This essentially serves as a cache of these variables so these records can be pulled up via SOQL by getTheGeoDef.

The idea is that an admin would import their records and run the geoCodey_ExtremePoint_BATCH, which will calculate the extreme points asyncronously. 


*geoCodey_UTIL methods: getTheGeoDef and geoDefIndivMatch*
These methods do the actual meat of this work. getTheGeoDef takes a latitude and longitude (how you get that is flexible!), looks for Geographic Definitions near the 
point (based on their cached extreme points) and then loops through those definitions to verify which definition they are within. It then returns the Id of the defnition
that the point lies within.
